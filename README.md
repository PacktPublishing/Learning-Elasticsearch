# Learning Elasticsearch
This is the code repository for [Learning Elasticsearch](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-elasticsearch?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787128453), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Elasticsearch is a modern, fast, distributed, scalable, fault tolerant, and open source search and analytics engine. You can use Elasticsearch for small or large applications with billions of documents. It is built to scale horizontally and can handle both structured and unstructured data. Packed with easy-to- follow examples, this book will ensure you will have a firm understanding of the basics of Elasticsearch and know how to utilize its capabilities efficiently.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
{
   "articleid": 1,
   "name": "Introduction to Elasticsearch"
}
```

The book was written using Elasticsearch 5.1.2, and all the examples used in the book
should work with it. The request format used in this book is based on the Kibana Console
and youâ€™ll need Kibana Console or Sense Chrome plugin to execute the examples used in
this book.
